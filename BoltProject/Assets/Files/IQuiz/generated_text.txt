1. What does a program consist of?
   A. A list of instructions to perform a given task
   B. A list of memory locations
   C. A set of registers
   D. A set of data to be used as operands

2. What happens to the contents of a register after an add operation?
   A. They are preserved
   B. They are overwritten
   C. They are moved to memory
   D. They are moved to the ALU

3. What is the purpose of the Instruction Register (IR)?
   A. To hold the instruction that is currently being executed
   B. To hold the address of the next instruction
   C. To hold the data to be written into or read out of the addressed location
   D. To hold the address of the location to be accessed

4. What is the role of the Memory Address Register (MAR)?
   A. To hold the instruction that is currently being executed
   B. To hold the address of the next instruction
   C. To hold the data to be written into or read out of the addressed location
   D. To hold the address of the location to be accessed

5. What does the Program Counter (PC) do?
   A. Keeps track of the execution of a program
   B. Holds the current instruction being executed
   C. Stores the data to be written into or read out of the addressed location
   D. Stores the address of the location to be accessed

6. What is the first step in moving data between memory and the processor?
   A. The PC is set to point to the first instruction
   B. The first instruction is read out of memory and loaded into MDR
   C. The contents of PC are transferred to MAR and a Read control signal is sent to memory
   D. The contents of MDR are transferred to IR

7. What happens when an interrupt is raised by an I/O device?
   A. The processor ignores the interrupt
   B. The processor provides the requested service by executing an appropriate interrupt-service routine
   C. The processor halts all operations
   D. The processor resets all registers

8. What must be done before the processor can service an interrupt?
   A. The processor state must be saved in memory locations
   B. The interrupt-service routine must be loaded into memory
   C. The PC must be set to point to the first instruction of the interrupt-service routine
   D. The contents of the IR must be transferred to the MDR

9. What happens to the contents of the PC during the execution of an instruction?
   A. They are preserved
   B. They are overwritten
   C. They are updated
   D. They are moved to the ALU

10. What is the purpose of machine instructions that handle I/O transfers?
   A. To accept data from input devices and send data to output devices
   B. To execute the current instruction
   C. To fetch the required operands for an operation
   D. To store the result of an operation in memory
