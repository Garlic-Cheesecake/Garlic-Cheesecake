BASIC OPERATIONAL 
CONCEPTS
Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.BASIC OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS
•Program:
•Consists of a list of instructions to perform a given task.
•It is stored in memory . 
•Individual instructions are brought from memory into processor .
•Processor executes the specified operations. 
•Data to be used as operands are also stored in memory .
Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.BASIC OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS CONT..
•Example instruction:
•Add LOCA, RO // RO = [LOCA] + [RO]
•Steps required to execute a instruction:
1.Instruction is fetched from memory into processor. 
2.Operand at memory location LOCA is fetched and added to contents 
of RO . 
3.Resulting sum is stored in register RO.
•This Add instruction combines a memory access operation with an ALU 
operation. 
•Original contents oflocation LOCA are preserved .
•RO are overwritten .
Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.BASIC OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS CONT..
•In many modern computers , memory access operation and ALU operation are 
performed by separate instructions for performance reasons. 
•Example:
•Load LOCA, R1 // transfers contents of LOCA into R1
•Add R1, RO // adds R1 and RO and places sum into RO
•It destroys the former contents of R1 and RO , whereas original contents of 
LOCA are preserved.
Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.Connection Between Processor and Memory
•Processor contains a number of registers 
used for several different purposes . 
1.Instruction register (IR) 
2.Program counter (PC) 
3.Memory address register (MAR)
4.Memory data register (MDR)
5.General -purpose register (R0 –Rn-1)

•Instruction register (IR) 
•Holds instruction that is currently being executed . 
•Its output is available to control circuits .
•Control circuits
•It generates timing signals that control the various processing 
elements involved in executing the instruction. 
•Program counter (PC) 
•It is another specialized register . 
•It keeps track of the execution of a program . 
•It contains memory address of next instruction to be fetched and 
executed. 
•During execution of an instruction, contents of PC are updated .Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.Connection Between Processor and Memory Cont..
•Finally, two registers facilitate communication with the memory. 
•Memory address register (MAR) 
•Holds the address of the location to be accessed. 
•Memory data register (MDR)
•Contains the data to be written into or read out of the addressed location .
Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.Operating Steps: Mov eData Between Memory 
and Processor
•Programs reside in memory .
•Execution starts when PC is set to point to first instruction . 
•Contents of PC are transferred to MAR and a Read control signal is sent to 
memory . 
•First instruction is read out of memory and loaded into MDR . 
•Next, contents of MDR are transferred to IR . 
•At this point, instruction is ready to be decoded and executed .
•If instruction involves an operation to be performed by ALU , it is necessary 
to obtain required operands . 
•If an operand resides in memory (or in a general -purpose register ), it has to 
be fetched by sending its address to MAR and initiating a Read cycle . 
Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.Operating Steps: Move Data Between Memory 
and Processor
•When operand has been read from memory into MDR , it is transferred from 
MDR to ALU . 
•After one or more operands are fetched in this way, ALU can perform 
desired operation. 
•If result is to be stored in memory , then result is sent to MDR . 
•Address of the location where result is to be stored is sent to the MAR , and 
a Write cycle is initiated . 
•At some point during the execution of the current instruction , the contents 
of the PC are incremented so that the PC points to the next instruction to be 
executed. 
•Thus, as soon as execution of current instruction is completed, a new 
instruction fetch may be started.Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.Move Data Between Processor and I/O devices
•Computer accepts data from input devices and sends data to output 
devices . 
•Thus, some machine instructions with the ability to handle I/O 
transfers are provided.
Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.Interrupt Processing 
•Interrupt is a request from an I/O device for service by the processor. 
•If some device requires urgent service then it raises an interrupt signal . 
•In order to deal with the situation immediately, normal execution of current 
program must be interrupted . 
•Processor provides the requested service by executing an appropriate interrupt -
service routine . 
•This diversions may alter the internal state of the processor .
•Processor state must be saved in memory locations before servicing the interrupt . 
•Normally, contents of PC, general registers , and some control inform ation are 
stored in memory . 
•When interrupt -service routine is completed , state of processor is restored so that 
interrupted program may continue.Dr.S.Meenatchi, SCORE, VIT, Vellore.
