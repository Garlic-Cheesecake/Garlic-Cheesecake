1. What does a program consist of?
   a. A list of instructions to perform a given task
   b. A sequence of random data
   c. A set of related software components
   d. A collection of hardware components

2. What is the function of the Instruction Register (IR) in a processor?
   a. Holds the instruction that is currently being executed
   b. Stores the memory address of the next instruction
   c. Keeps track of the execution of a program
   d. Facilitates communication with the memory

3. What does the Program Counter (PC) do in a processor?
   a. Keeps track of the execution of a program
   b. Holds the instruction that is currently being executed
   c. Stores the data to be written into memory
   d. Holds the address of the memory location to be accessed

4. What does the Memory Address Register (MAR) do?
   a. Holds the address of the location to be accessed
   b. Contains the data to be written into memory
   c. Holds the instruction that is currently being executed
   d. Stores the memory address of the next instruction

5. What does the Memory Data Register (MDR) contain?
   a. The data to be written into or read out of the addressed location
   b. The address of the memory location to be accessed
   c. The instruction that is currently being executed
   d. The memory address of the next instruction to be fetched

6. What happens when an interrupt is raised?
   a. Normal execution of the current program must be interrupted
   b. The current program continues to execute normally
   c. The processor goes into sleep mode
   d. The memory storage is cleared

7. What is the purpose of the ALU operation in an instruction?
   a. To perform arithmetic and logical operations
   b. To store data in memory
   c. To fetch instructions from memory
   d. To handle I/O transfers

8. What happens when an operand has been read from memory into the Memory Data Register (MDR)?
   a. It is transferred from the MDR to the ALU
   b. It is written back into memory
   c. It is transferred to the Program Counter (PC)
   d. It is transferred to the Memory Address Register (MAR)

9. What does the control circuit do in the processor?
   a. Generates timing signals that control the various processing elements
   b. Stores the memory address of the next instruction
   c. Contains the data to be written into or read out of the addressed location
   d. Holds the instruction that is currently being executed

10. What happens during the execution of a current instruction?
   a. The contents of the PC are incremented so that the PC points to the next instruction
   b. The contents of the PC are decremented
   c. The contents of the PC remain the same
   d. The contents of the PC are cleared
